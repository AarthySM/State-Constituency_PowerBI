# State-wise Constituency in India

## Project Overview
This repository contains my first Power BI project titled **"State-wise Constituency in India."** This project focuses on visualizing constituency data across different states and union territories (UTs) in India, along with insights into the distribution of constituencies based on political alliances (NDA/INDI) and parties.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **State/UT:** The state or union territory within India.
- **NDA/INDI:** The political alliance (NDA or INDI) in power.
- **Party:** The political party in power.
- **Total Constituency:** The total number of constituencies within the state/UT.

## Key Visuals and Analysis
- **Total States/UTs & Constituencies (Card Visuals):** 
  - Display the total number of states/UTs and the overall number of constituencies in India.
  
- **Constituency Distribution by NDA/INDI (Stacked Column Chart):**
  - Calculate and visualize the overall count of constituencies by political alliance (NDA/INDI).
  
- **Constituency Distribution by State/UT (Clustered Column Chart):**
  - Analyze the sum of total constituencies across different states/UTs.

- **Constituency Distribution by Party (Clustered Column Chart):**
  - Calculate the total sum of constituencies by political party.

- **Data Slicers:**
  - Two slicers are used to filter the data by **State/UT** and **NDA/INDI** for more focused analysis.

## Conclusion
This project represents a foundational understanding of Power BI and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced data visualization projects. The visualizations provide clear insights into the political landscape of India's constituencies across states and union territories.
